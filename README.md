## Smart Agriculture system based on IoT

* To improve the sustainability of agriculture, this project has used the concept of Internet of Things and the state-of-art sensors to precisely measure soil parameters like
temperature, humidity and soil moisture. 
* The farmer can have insights on the current values of these variables using a mobile or web application. 
To identify other conditions like maximum temperature, minimum temperature and wind speed that might impact his yield, real-time weather forecasting is done using an external platform (Open Weather API). 
* The farmer can also use this application for irrigating his field. The motor can be controlled using the application from anywhere as long as each of these devices remain connected to the network.
